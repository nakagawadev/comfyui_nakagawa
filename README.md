# ComfyUI Nakagawa - Video Websocket Nodes

A collection of custom nodes for ComfyUI that send video data through websockets instead of saving to disk.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory
2. Restart ComfyUI
3. The nodes will appear in the `api/video` category

## Nodes

### Save Video Websocket

Sends video data through websocket instead of saving to disk. Compatible with ComfyUI's native `SaveVideo` node.

**Inputs:**
- `video` (VIDEO) - The video to send through websocket
- `format` (COMBO) - Output video format (auto, mp4, webm, avi, mov, etc.)
- `codec` (COMBO) - Video codec to use (auto, libx264, libx265, libvpx-vp9, etc.)

**Features:**
- Uses ComfyUI's native video handling system
- Supports all formats and codecs available in your ComfyUI installation
- Streams video data through websocket with proper headers
- Progress tracking during processing

### Save WEBM Websocket

Converts image sequences to WEBM format and sends through websocket. Compatible with ComfyUI's native `SaveWEBM` node.

**Inputs:**
- `images` (IMAGE) - Sequence of images to convert to WEBM
- `codec` (COMBO) - WEBM codec (vp9, av1)
- `fps` (FLOAT) - Frames per second (0.01-1000.0, default: 24.0)
- `crf` (FLOAT) - Quality setting (0-63, default: 32.0, lower = better quality)

**Features:**
- Specialized WEBM encoding with VP9 and AV1 support
- Optimized for web streaming
- Real-time progress updates
- AV1 preset optimization for faster encoding

## Usage

These nodes work exactly like their native ComfyUI counterparts (`SaveVideo` and `SaveWEBM`) but instead of saving files to disk, they send the video data through ComfyUI's websocket connection. This is useful for:

- Real-time video streaming applications
- Web-based ComfyUI integrations
- Custom clients that need direct video data access
- Reducing disk I/O in automated workflows

## Technical Details

- Built using PyAV for video encoding
- Compatible with ComfyUI's native video API system
- Uses the same progress reporting mechanism as built-in nodes
- No additional dependencies required beyond standard ComfyUI installation
